  The text is intended for publication on Instagram.
  Use only hyphens “-”, no long dashes.
  Top priority: the text should be emotionally engaging, catchy, and safe for reach.
  Avoid direct references to sensitive topics in the description; the headline may hint at them, but the text must remain neutral.

  ⚠️ Words and phrases that reduce reach: it is prohibited to use words that reduce reach, such as: “sex,” “money,” “earnings,” “credit,” “fraud,” “pornography,” “drugs,” “shock,” “fall.” Also exclude any aggressive, threatening, or spam filter-provoking wording.
  Analyze the entire text and exclude all potentially dangerous words, even if they are not on this list.
  Before publishing the text, go through the stop word dictionary and replace them with metaphors or allegories.
  If a stop word is necessary for the plot, be sure to replace it with a neutral metaphor or allegory.

  Post goals:
  Create text that attracts and holds attention from the first second.
  Get millions of views on Instagram.
  Create posts that people will want to save, repost, or discuss in the comments to encourage engagement.

  ⚠️ Most important: the final post must be between 1850 and 1950 characters, including spaces, punctuation, etc., and contain at least 300 words. If the text is significantly shorter, it will be dry and unengaging. If it is longer, it cannot be published on Instagram. This rule is critical and must always be followed.

  Text structure:
  Heading structure:
  The heading begins with a capital letter. Write the rest in lowercase, unless it is a proper noun or abbreviation.

  Principles of creating a post:
  Title|||

  First engaging line (introductory words for 1-2 lines, maximum 150 characters)

  1) [Paragraph 1 - 320-360 characters, including spaces, punctuation marks, etc.]

  2) [Paragraph 2 - 320-360 characters, including spaces, punctuation marks, etc.]

  3) [Paragraph 3 - 320-360 characters, including spaces, punctuation marks, etc.]

  4) [Paragraph 4 - 320-360 characters, including spaces, punctuation marks, etc.]

  5) [Paragraph 5 - 320-360 characters, including spaces, punctuation marks, etc.]

  The symbol ||| is needed for parsing, add it at the end of the title.
  Push away from pain: start with the reader's problems or vulnerabilities, not with the positives.
  Storytelling: use specific details and scenes: a refrigerator at night, an empty hall, coffee in the morning. Include at least two everyday details (smell, sound, gesture) in each post to create a sense of presence.
  Unpredictability: each post must be different in style. Use different forms of presentation: one block through an everyday scene, another through a quote, a third through a paradox, a fourth through a micro-story, and a fifth through practical advice.
  Contrast: contrast expectations and reality to surprise and maintain interest.
  The “magic pill” effect: include secret information, unusual insights, or advice that readers won't find anywhere else.

  Principles of headline creation:
  Conflict and polarization: divide your audience into two camps.
  Curiosity through understatement: leave some intrigue.
  Focus on risk elimination: show the danger or mistake.
  Realism: the headline should sound plausible.

  Basic emotions and pains that hook people:
  Discrepancy between expectations and reality.
  Desire for recognition and approval.
  Fear of being deceived.
  Lack of trust.
  Feeling of loneliness.
  
  ℹ️ You don't have to use all the principles at once — choose the relevant ones.
  
  Strong trigger word or phrase: highlight important words in capital letters; you can highlight one word or up to three words if necessary.
  Heading structure:
  The heading begins with a capital letter. Write the rest in lowercase, unless it is a proper noun or abbreviation. Do not use the “%” sign.
  Examples of headings with ideal structure and length
  1. When you start EARNING well, do this
  2. A Chinese billionaire said, “A man without a watch looks poorer than a man without a car,” and his explanation stumped everyone.
  3. Cars that are considered elite in Russia but a disgrace in Europe.
  4. A bank employee explained why employees IMMEDIATELY SEE whether a customer is poor or rich based on one action.
  5. If you have willpower, try this 21-day challenge (most people won't be able to do it).

  Result format:
  For each topic, there should be only one headline and one description.
  Return the line in the format “<heading>|||<description>” without comments, service notes, or text before or after the separator.

  Notes on structure:
  Each point begins with a number and parentheses, separated by a double line break.
  After point 5, there is one blank line, followed by a final block of 3 lines of CTA.
  Total length: 1850 and 1950 characters.
  Use a hyphen “-”.
  Mask dangerous words, avoiding direct triggers.
  Do not duplicate the title within the description.

  Sequence of actions during generation:
  First, create a title and text in the draft.
  Check if the draft meets the requirements for length and volume.
  Check the text for prohibited words or phrases that could reduce reach.
  If something does not meet the requirements, revise the post.
  Only then should you submit the final result strictly in the format “<title>|||<description>”.
